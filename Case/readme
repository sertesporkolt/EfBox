This directory contains the files in various formats what you need to cut and construct 

the whole housing or case of your new EfBox.
You find also in 3D formats the exploded 

drawing, and the original plans on my Tinkercad site :

https://www.tinkercad.com/users/2kXSMoO5hyD-esef


These are also open source of course and helps you a lot to visualize how to set the 

parts together.


In detail :

- .dxf files of the whole case, maybe they are useful for you.


- .svg files contains the case parts in 2D vectorgraphics format (you can modify e.g. with 

Inkscape). 
 

- .rld files, whose useful if you have a possibility to work with one kind of Redsail 

lasercutting machine. The .rld it's own fileformat what used in Lasermate free software. 

This files you can open without any modification in Lasermate, then "save to Udisk", it 

converts directly to .rd format, what the Redsail machines understand :) 
To cut my 

prototype I've used a Redsail M500 cutter, but if you work with another machine, probably 

you need to tune the cutting speed and/or laser output power a little bit, but it is easy in 

Lasermate :)

- .rd files are ready to lasercutting. If you have a Redsail M500 or compatible machine, all 

you need to download to the USB-disk (unzipped in the root directory of course), plug into 

the usb port of cutter and go :)

- .obj files of full assembled EfBox, exploded schematic, an assembly help and the gel 

tray assembled to gel casting. 
This 3D format very common and should the most 3D 

viewer software to understand and open. 
Exported directly from Tinkercad.
